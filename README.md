# TRMS-PYTHON-PRJ-1
A Collection of my Project 1 Files

The Tuition Reimbursement System, TRMS, allows users to submit reimbursements for courses and training. The submitted reimbursement must be approved by that employee's supervisor, department head, and benefits coordinator. The benefits coordinator then reviews the grade received before finalizing the reimbursement.

Technologies Used
Python - version 3.1
Postman - version 2.0
JavaScript - version 3.0
Visual Studio - version

Features
Pages are still under construction, login and password works rudimentarily, and numerous buttons are yet to be implemented.

Login and Create User page works!
Create Reimbursement Request has interactive forms features.

To-do list:

Finalize working buttons and non-working buttons.
Establish differentiation on supervisor, manager and benefits coordinator in login sections.

To get started, click the "Code" button at top of the repository and clone (click on the pages icon) next to the repository name. After that, go to your desktop, create a new project folder and in the folder open up a Git Bash command prompt (Right-click "Git Bash Here").
Once open, type "git clone" and right-click so you can paste the cloned repository name. Press Enter and you will then see the repository downloaded into the folder.

Open up Python and load the pages into the Python platform (or create a new project, name it "TRMS_Project" and import the files and folders).

You will need to be logged into an Amazon AWS account, and make up your own database connection and credentials in order to proceed with running the app.
Download Flask, Selenium, PsycoPG 2 and Flask Cors to keep up to date with the project.
